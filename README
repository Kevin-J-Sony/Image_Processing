This is where I try implementing image processing algorithms.

The links I've used that helped me with building a JPEG decoder:

https://www.opennet.ru/docs/formats/jpeg.txt
https://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/itu-t81.pdf

To be honest, this was such an overwhelming project to do again. I don't think I will be implementing all the features/specifications of JPEG.
